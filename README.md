# Bootloader_STM32f4 and Self Programming

simple Bootloader for STM32f401CC.

Project Description:
  the bootloader folder include the Bootloader code (use the Flasher/Debugger to burn this code into MCU FLASH)
  then you use the USB to TTL to burn the new code using (USART Communication Protocol) -> use the Python script to send the data through your port.
